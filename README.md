# MannekenPisProperties

Welcome to MannekenPisProperties, the only Python-powered apartment hunting tool you'll ever need! This little script will help you and your roommates find your dream rental in Brussels without the usual headaches. 

## Why MannekenPisProperties?

Just like the famous Manneken Pis statue in Brussels, our script might be small, but it sure makes a big splash! It's designed to take the stress out of apartment hunting by doing the hard work for you. 

## What Does It Do?

MannekenPisProperties uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape through countless property listings in Brussels. It then uses pandas to tidy up the data and output it into a user-friendly CSV file. 

## Key Features

- Scrape property listings from selected postcodes.
- Filter by property type (house/apartment or both).
- Specify your range for floor area and number of bedrooms.
- And, the pi√®ce de r√©sistance, it records the URL for each listing so you can check them out later!

## How to Use It?

Adjust the parameters at the beginning of the script to match your preferences, run the script, and voila! MannekenPisProperties will generate a CSV file with all the relevant listings.

## Warning

MannekenPisProperties may occasionally be caught taking a break to enjoy a cone of frites or a Belgian waffle. Please do not be alarmed, this is a feature, not a bug. üçüüßá
